Hi, this is Dongwei Xiao's homepage.

I am currently a third-year PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Prof. Shuai Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~shuaiw/).
  Before joining HKUST, I received my B.Eng. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China in 2021.

My research currently focuses on **Software Engineering**.
