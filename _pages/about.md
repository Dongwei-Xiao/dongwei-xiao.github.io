Hi, this is Dongwei Xiao's homepage.

I am currently a second-year PhD student at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Prof. Shuai Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~shuaiw/).
  Before joining HKUST, I received my B.Eng. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China in 2021.

My research currently focuses on **Software Engineering**.

Education
------
**Ph.D.**, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology  &emsp; &nbsp; *Sept 2021 - Now*

**B.E.** in Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &nbsp; *Sept 2017 - June 2021*

Academic Projects
======
**DNN Compiler Testing**, SIGMETRICS 2022 &emsp; *March 2021 - Oct 2021*
 * We tested several industry-level Deep Learning Compilers, including [TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/), [Glow](https://github.com/pytorch/glow), and [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla).

**Lifter Benchmarking**, S&P 2022 &emsp; *Apr 2020 - Apr 2021*
 * We quantitatively evaluate performance of LLVM IR lifters on supporting downstream applications including pointer analysis, binary similarity analysis and decompilation.

**Decompiler Testing**, ISSTA 2020 &emsp; *Jan 2019 - Mar 2020*
 * We design a framework to automatically find errors and defects in modern decmopilers including commercial decompiler and open-source decompiler developed by NSA.
